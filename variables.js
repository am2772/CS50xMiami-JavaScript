1. The Age Calculator
Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!
- Store the current year in a variable.
- Store their birth year in a variable.
- Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
- Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

2. The Lifetime Supply Calculator
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
- Store your current age into a variable.
- Store a maximum age into a variable.
- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
- Output the result to the screen like so:
"You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

3. The Geometrizer
Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:
http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm
- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

4. The Temperature Converter
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
*/

var fahrenheit = prompt ("Fahrenheit to Celsius converter\n\n Please enter temperature in Fahrenheit degrees: ");
var fahrenheitToC = ((fahrenheit - 32)*5)/9;
console.log(fahrenheit + ' Fahrenheit degrees is ' + fahrenheitToC + ' Celsius degrees');
